of altered EGFR signaling, A549 cells were transfected with control or Rin1-specific
morpholinos, serum-starved, and then stimulated with EGF. The levels
of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK) were used to assess EGF signaling (Fig. 2C). Depletion
of Rin1 from A549 cells resulted in at least a 2-fold decrease in pERK levels

proliferation, Rin1Δ or wild type Rin1 expression constructs were transfected into
A549 cells and assayed for colony formation (Fig. 5, A and B). Only Rin1Δ expression
